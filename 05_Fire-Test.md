Titanium has a melting point of 1668°C which is roughly 250°C higher than stainless steel and roughly twice as high as the average house fire. Titanium is also highly resistive to corrosion and has been used widely in the areospace and pressure vessel industries for the last 70 years. These attributes make it a supiror medium to secure your Bitcoin seed phrase.
